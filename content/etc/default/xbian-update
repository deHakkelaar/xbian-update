# Configuration for xbian-update

# Normally upgrading xbian-update results in an automated reboot if XBMC is not
# running.  This is done to make sure that all daemons are restarted with the
# appropriate updated configuration.
# A more advanced user might not want that, as it may break, for example, a
# development environment.  This is achieved by setting DISABLE_AUTO_REBOOT to
# "yes please" (yes, it's on purpose).
#DISABLE_AUTO_REBOOT=""
